Financial Academia — Project Description

Financial Academia is a web-based financial literacy platform designed to make learning finance simple and engaging. The application provides different user experiences based on age, ensuring appropriate content and interactions for all users.

Users below 18 are guided through a gamified learning interface with quizzes, daily tasks, and reward-based activities to build basic financial awareness. Users 18 and above gain access to more advanced features such as stock market analysis games, financial task planning, and interactive challenges.

The platform includes secure OTP-based authentication, a personalized dashboard, progress tracking, and a reward system to encourage consistent learning. Financial Academia focuses on delivering an intuitive, age-appropriate, and interactive approach to financial education.
